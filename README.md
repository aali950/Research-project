Input scripts for LAMMPS  

This is an example LAMMPS input script used for CPE 440 Research project. 

  Includes files for a non-polarisable force field to simulate [Bmim][Cl] in solution at 75% mol water and     25% mol of IL
  
  Also, the input script used to compute viscosity 
  
  This repository can be used to reproduce results from my simulations if desired
   
  Need to download LAMMPS, Packmol and fftool to use
  
Thank you,
Amir
